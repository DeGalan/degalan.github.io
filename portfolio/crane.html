                <h1>Crane VS. Crane</h1>
                <p class="desc-a">In 2021, a plethora of new development was being approved very suddenly in my hometown of Dublin, California.</p>
                <p class="desc-a">“Crane VS. Crane” protests new development by pressuring people to either side with the animals (cranes) or the lifeless equipment (cranes).</p>
                <div id="caption-c1" class="caption">Between the two cranes—a question emerges: Which crane do you want to see more of?</div>

                <h2>Creating the Campaign</h2>
                <p class="desc-a">Establishing a face for this campaign was pretty difficult in its early stages. Here are some of the sketches I made before reaching the final stages of the campaign.</p>
                <div id="caption-c2" class="caption">Original concept sketches, including two characters from the original campaign idea!</div>

            <div>
                <h2 style="margin-bottom: -0.25em">Moving Forward</h2>
                <p class="c1">Although the average resident of Dublin, California might not have much of a voice in regards to preventing additional development, it is important to remain persistent. It has been more than two years since this campaign has launched; that does not prevent me from keeping the message alive!</p>
